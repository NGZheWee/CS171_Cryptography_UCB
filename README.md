# CS171: Cryptography (Spring 2024, UCB)

This repository contains coursework from **CS171: Cryptography**, which I took in Spring 2024 at UC Berkeley. The course explores the mathematical foundations and practical applications of cryptography, focusing on securing communication and data through encryption and cryptographic protocols.

## Contents:

- **Homework**: Contains homework assignments that cover cryptographic concepts, including encryption, decryption, hash functions, and digital signatures.

## Key Concepts Covered:

- **Symmetric Cryptography**: Understanding block ciphers (e.g., AES) and stream ciphers, and their usage for secure communication.
- **Public-Key Cryptography**: Implementing RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for secure key exchange and encryption.
- **Hash Functions**: Working with cryptographic hash functions (e.g., SHA-256) to ensure data integrity.
- **Digital Signatures**: Understanding the creation and verification of digital signatures to authenticate messages.
- **Cryptographic Protocols**: Analyzing protocols such as SSL/TLS for secure data transmission.

## How to Navigate:

- **Homework**: All homework assignments are located under the `Homework/` directory, each containing code and solutions for cryptography-related problems, including encryption/decryption exercises and protocol analysis.


Explore the coursework to see practical applications of cryptographic principles and protocols, focusing on securing data and communications through encryption techniques.
